/**
 * RGB Tree: A kd tree is a generalization of a binary search tree
 * for keys of multiple dimensions. Since our keys are RGBAPixels,
 * we will refer to our kd tree as an RGBTree. We typically consider 
 * a kd tree to be a spatial structure whose keys are k-dimensional 
 * points in space. Its core functionality is to allow for nearest 
 * neighbor search within the space. That is, we don't necessarily 
 * search for particular keys, but rather, we search for a key that is 
 * "close" to the query key.
 * 
 * You should not remove anything from this class definition, but
 * you will find it helpful to add your own private helper functions 
 * to it.
 *
 * This file will be submitted for grading, so you are welcome to add 
 * helper functions and auxiliary data.

  /**
   * Constructor that builds a rgbtree out of a given 
   * map<rgbapixel,string>.
   * 
    * KDTree structure:
    * We represent the tree as a nearly perfect binary tree, whose "nodes"
    * are the entries of an array. Given n keys, the root is in array
    * position n/2, root->left is in approx position n/4, root->right is 
    * in approx position 3n/4, etc. (Integer division is your friend.)
    *
    * KDTree order:
    * A KDtree is a generalization of a binary search tree applied to 
    * k dimensional data (a bst is a 1d tree). For each level of the
    * tree we designate a splitting dimension, and for each node on
    * that level, we partition the keys in that node's subtree about the 
    * median value in the splitting dimension -- smaller keys to the left, 
    * and larger keys to the right. The splitting dimension is chosen by 
    * rotating through the k dimensions: in general, the splitting 
    * dimension is "level mod k". 
    *
    * RGBTree:
    * Our kdtree applies specifically to the RGB color space, and as such,
    * it's a 3d tree. We arbitrarily designate ['r', 'g', 'b'] as the order
    * in which we cycle through the dimensions. This means that at level 0, 
    * the root is the median red value, and on the left, all points have  
    * red <= that median, and on the right all points have red >= that median.
    * At the next level, the root's left subtree will consist of approximately 
    * n/2 points, and we partition those according to the green dimension, and
    * similarly for the right subtree.
    *
    * Median finding:
    * If someone magically handed you the median at each level of the tree, 
    * your work would be done. "quickSelect(k)" is an algorithm 
    * based on the partition function of quickSort that returns the kth largest element
    * in a collection (we want the median): Choose an arbitrary element to be 
    * the pivot, and complete the partition. If the pivot turned out to be the 
    * median, then stop and celebrate. If it wasn't, then you have at least 
    * narrowed the search space for the median, because it must be in the larger 
    * of the two partitions.  Use quickSelect, recursively, on the appropriate 
    * segment of the array, searching for the median element. The precise
    * parameter to use for the recursive call is for you to figure out
    * when you complete your implementation.

     * Finds the closest point to the parameter (query) point in the RGBTree.
     *
     * This function takes a reference to a RGBAPixel and
     * returns the  RGBAPixel closest to it in the tree. We are defining
     * closest here to be the minimum Euclidean distance between pixels.
     * If there are ties (this time in distance), they must be
     * decided using RGBAPixel::operator<().
     *
    * You will almost certainly want to create a recursive helper function
    * for which this public interface is merely a wrapper.
    * 
    * findNearestNeighbor(queryPixel) works as follows:
    * Throughout the computation, we maintain the nearest known neighbor, and
    * its distance from the query pixel. At every node, the nearest known 
    * neighbor is the best of A) the nearest known neighbor in the subtree 
    * containing the queryPixel, B) the pixel at the node, and C) the nearest
    * neighbor in the other subtree *if it should be searched*. (We hope we 
    * don't have to pursue C.)  
    * 
    * Pruning the search:
    * We can argue that a subtree need not be searched if all of its points
    * must be farther from the queryPixel than the nearest-known-neighbor.
    * To evaluate this, we note that the current node partitions space in one
    * dimension and one of those partitions *doesn't* contain the queryPoint. If the 
    * queryPoint is farther than the current-best-distance from the root *in 
    * only that dimension*, then it is farther than the current-best-distance 
    * from all points in that subtree, and the subtree need not be searched.
    * 
    * We leave the design decision on how to handle empty subtrees to you!
